# Resolving a run's party (live, not roster)

A run's canonical party is the **DEPLOYED** heroes — their IDENTITY (the heroKeys) read LIVE from
`StageManager.HeroList` (`read_live_party`), on the instance chosen by `pick_live_sm`. The save lists the
**roster** (every hero above level 1): playing solo with the Ranger, the save lists all 6, but only the
Ranger is on the field. Confusing roster with party means showing unplayed heroes (the symptom: several
with `+0xp`).

**Identity is LIVE; level/exp degrade to the save (1.00.20).** Through 1.00.19, `read_live_party` also
read each deployed hero's live within-level level/exp from the ACTk `fakeValue` PLAIN decoy
(`HeroRuntime.LEVEL_FAKE`/`EXP_FAKE`). The 1.00.20 recompile ZEROED that decoy build-wide; the real live
level/exp moved behind the ObscuredInt/Float cipher, which is **off-limits**
([[invariants/obscured-data-offlimits]] — decoding `hidden^key` is forbidden and would re-break every
build). So `read_live_party` now sources level from the **save** and forces **exp = None**. This keeps the
PARTY fully LIVE (membership is still `StageManager.HeroList`); only the level/exp *values* fall back to
the save (LIVE→SAVE, [[invariants/metric-fallback-chains]]) — it NEVER lets the roster define the party.
`exp = None` is deliberate: feeding the stale save exp into the live xp accumulator would make the SAVE
fallback masquerade as `xp_source="live"` (forbidden), so the accumulator stays empty, `xp_total_live`
is `None`, and `close_run` honestly tags the run's xp `save` (capped heroes → 0, as ever).

## `pick_live_sm`: NO cap, and the SAME validation as `read_live_party`

`pick_live_sm` scans the StageManager instances and returns the first one from which `read_live_party`
extracts ≥1 valid DEPLOYED hero — it calls `read_live_party` **itself**, so pick and read use the
SAME validation. It has to scan **ALL** candidates (like `pick_live_csd`), with no fixed cap: the
carrier can be at ANY index. A fixed cap lost the carrier whenever the backref returned more than the
limit — nailed in 1.00.11: **1162 instances** of StageManager (vs ~450 in older builds), the carrier
beyond 600 → `StageManager NOT found` EVEN in combat → the party fell back to the roster.

**The ghost discriminator (and why it changed in 1.00.20).** Among the candidates there are **ghost**
instances — torn-down/template StageManagers, the SAME family as [[invariants/instance-selection]] (the
scan finds the K-class in dozens of slots that are not the live object). `read_live_party` must reject a
ghost while accepting every real deployed hero. The discriminator is the deployed **heroKey resolving a
real class in `hero_cat`**: a real hero carries one of the catalog keys; a ghost carries a stale/garbage
key that doesn't. (Through 1.00.19 the discriminator was a valid `heroKey` with `lvl>0`; 1.00.20 killed
the live level decoy, so a `lvl>0` gate would reject EVERY real hero — empty party → `sm` NOT found →
`hero-class`/`xp-live`/`stats` cascade-fail. Verified in 1.00.20: among ALL StageManager instances ONLY
the deployed ones carry a catalog heroKey, so the catalog check is a clean, name-free replacement.)
`pick_live_sm` takes `hero_cat` and applies the SAME discriminator.

**Why pick and read MUST agree (the 1.00.13 regression).** `pick_live_sm` returns the first candidate
`read_live_party` extracts a party from — it CALLS `read_live_party`, so pick and read use the SAME
validation by construction. The 1.00.13 bug was a pick that used a WEAKER check than read: it accepted a
ghost, the meter FROZE on it (`if not sm` in the loop) and `read_live_party` read `{}` the whole session →
`StageManager ok — 0 heroes deployed`, every run `heroes:err`, invalid runs with no team. It only hit
anyone who had a ghost BEFORE the carrier in memory order (hence "worked on the dev's machine" and passed
`validate_live`). The fix is that pick and read share the discriminator (today: heroKey + `hero_cat`); the
level/exp source NEVER gates — it only fills values — so the two can't drift apart again.
`describe_sm_candidates` (in `reader-diag.log`) logs candidates / carriers-vs-ghosts / chosen — the data
the debug was missing. With no readable candidate → `None` (degrade honestly, NEVER a ghost that read
can't read).

## Honest degradation: party off becomes `err`, NEVER the roster

`hero_in_run(hero_key, live_keys)` is the single inclusion rule: **only** whoever is in the LIVE party
gets in (`live_keys` = HeroList ∪ party_seen). When the live party doesn't resolve the WHOLE run (sm
null), **nobody gets in** — the reader emits `heroes: err("party live off")` in the `raw/<id>.json`
envelope. NEVER the save roster (the bug of 5 heroes with +0xp) nor a proxy-guess by xp>0 (would catch a
hero who only gained idle xp, re-introducing the bug): unknown party ≠ guessed party.

`heroes` is a **CRITICAL** field in the converter ([[process/data-contract-id-based]]): `heroes: err` →
`issues["heroes"]` → the run is sealed **`degraded`**. By the #262 rule: **it doesn't go to the leaderboard**
(`auto-upload` skips degraded ones) but it **shows in the app**, marked and filterable (`hideNonCounted`,
"Skip != hide"). The `meter.log` line still carries `⚠` for the maintainer, and the `validate_live` gate
catches it live — the degradation is never silent.
