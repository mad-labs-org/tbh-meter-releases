"""meter_windows.py — PER-RUN METER (v4). RUNS ON WINDOWS. ZERO deps. Memory-read only.

Each RUN (one stage attempt) records:
  - status: SUCCESS (StageClearLog) or FAIL (StageFailedLog)
  - Stage A-B + mode (Normal/Nightmare/Hell/Torment), all from StageInfoData[currentStageKey]
  - total damage (HP drop) + DPS, mobs X/total (boss counts as +1, no problem)
  - gold/xp GAINED in the run (delta from save; the save is a snapshot -> only at close)
  - hero SHEET at the START of the run (class, level, equipped items w/ rarity and
    decorations/engravings/inscriptions) — frozen (ignores equip swaps mid-run)
If you switch stage mid-run without clearing/failing -> the partial run is ABANDONED and restarts.

Outputs in --output (default ~/tbh-meter): raw/<ts_ms>.json (1 RAW record per run; id = END timestamp
in ms, no session/counter — Redesign 2; the app's converter turns it into logs/<id>.json), live.json
(RAW snapshot of the current run, overwritten ~1x/s, the app cooks the overlay), meter.log (event log,
timestamped), resolve_cache.json. The reader is a DUMB SENSOR: it emits raw to both streams; the app
derives dps/label/format and the SESSION (no cooking here).
Run: python meter_windows.py [--output DIR] [--hz N] [--debug] (Ctrl+C exits).

    testable: touches no memory or clock (`elapsed`/reads come in as parameters). Mirrors
    app/src/shared/live-types.ts::RawLive (keys 1:1).

    - No `run_outcome`: the live is ALWAYS the in-progress run (the outcome only exists at close → goes in

      nothing persists). A field that didn't resolve becomes `null` (live gold/xp) or disappears in the app —
      unlike the per-run raw/<id>.json, which IS audited (there the envelope distinguishes "didn't-read" from
      "read zero"). The live never writes permanent junk, so it doesn't need ok/err.
    - `stageKey`/`act`/`stageNo`/`difficulty` go RAW (the app formats "3-9" and the mode name at render).
    - `goldNow`/`xpNow` = live gain accumulated in the run (live→save chain, see metric-fallback-chains);

      emit it → the app detects by presence and the overlay degrades (no tooltip). Empty = no live party.
    - `party_progress` = {heroKey: {level, exp, gain}} — the per-hero LIVE leveling snapshot (level +
      within-level exp + run-accumulated xp, built by metrics/xp.party_progress) that powers the overlay's
